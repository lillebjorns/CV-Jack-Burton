                <p>My name is Jack Burton. I have a strong will, an analytical mind, a fifth sense for a great gambling opportunity and overall a very charming personality. I'm a heroic kind of guy, always rising to the occasion and overall being THE GUY. You know the guy, quick with a sarcastic joke, knock a guy out with one punch, suave, quick on my feet, always in control and always on it, whatever it may be</p>
                <p>I'm a truck driver by trade, but I have many other things going on at all times. For example, my friend Wang once needed my help picking up his wife to be at the airport. While I was chatting up this reporter, Wang's wife was kidnapped. Not being the kind of guy to back out of helping a friend, of course, I immediately agreed to help Wang get her back. Lesser men would have backed out at the first obstacle, being threatened with a knife. I didn't even flinch as things escalated from there in events including my truck being stolen, firefights, swordfights, and otherworldly events. All just a day in the life of Jack Burton, ME</p>
